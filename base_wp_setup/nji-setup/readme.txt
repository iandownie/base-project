ACF Version: 5.2.2

Advanced Custom Fields fieldgroup definitions exported to JSON. Files must be
manually imported using the ACF import tool. Exports are not meant to be
manually edited. Changes should be administered using ACF, and any configuration
changes should be re-exported and stored in this location.

Note: Currently, the "Generate Export Code" option is not used because while
fieldgroups registered in code work, the groups do not appear in the ACF control
panel, which would make future updates difficult to manage.
